# My First GitHub Project
Welcome to my first GitHub project! In this project, I aim to get familiar with GitHub and explore its various features.

## Description
GitHub is a widely-used version control platform that allows developers to collaborate, manage, and track changes to their codebase. Through this project, I will learn the basics of using GitHub and understand how to effectively contribute to open-source projects.

## Goals
* Learn the fundamentals of version control using Git and GitHub.
* Understand the concept of repositories, branches, and commits.
* Practice creating, cloning, and managing repositories.
* Explore the process of collaborating with others through pull requests.
* Gain experience with issue tracking and project management on GitHub.
